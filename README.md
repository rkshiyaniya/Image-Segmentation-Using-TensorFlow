# Image Segmentation
This Repository contains TensorFlow implementation of different Image Segmentation Architecture on different types of datasets.

# VGG16 - FCN8 for Image Segmentation
* This [notebook](https://github.com/rkshiyaniya/Image-Segmentation-Using-TensorFlow/blob/main/VGG16_FCN8_CamVid.ipynb) contains VGG16-FCN8 architecture for image segmentation.
* In-depth Details about dataset, model architecture all things are well explained in the notebook itself.
* If you like it please give a star.
* If any suggestions or update please do let me know.
